* faq/ask_warranty
 -  The California Supreme Court has recognized that every residential lease carries with it an implied warranty of habitability.  This means that a landlord is legally responsible for repairing conditions that seriously affect the rental unit’s habitability, such as:

    Substantial defects in the rental unit
    Substantial failures to comply with state/local building and health codes
    Tenants are required by law to take reasonable care of their rental units and are responsible for repair of all damage that results from their neglect or abuse.
