## ask deposit use
* faq/ask_deposit_use
  - The landlord can use the security deposit if a tenant:
    Moves out owing rent
    Damages the rental unit beyond normal wear and tear
    Leaves the unit less clean than when it was rented
    Fails to restore personal property (such as keys or furniture), other than because of normal wear and tear.

## ask deposit wait
* faq/ask_deposit_wait
  - California Civil Code §1950.5 (g) requires that within 21 days after a tenant has vacated the unit, the owner must either: 
    1) return the security deposit to the tenant, 
    2) furnish a copy of an itemized statement indicating the amount of any part of the security deposit used (e.g. for unpaid rent, repairs, etc.), or 
    3) a combination of #1 and #2.
    Under California Civil Code §1950.5(f)(1), a tenant has the right to request an initial move-out inspection.
    Also, under California Civil Code §1950.5(e), a tenant should not be charged for normal wear and tear of the property.
    Finally, a tenant should obtain proof of items charged if over $126.  Cal. Civ. Code §1950.5(g)(2).

## ask warranty of habitability
* faq/ask_warranty
 -  The California Supreme Court has recognized that every residential lease carries with it an implied warranty of habitability.  This means that a landlord is legally responsible for repairing conditions that seriously affect the rental unit’s habitability, such as:

    Substantial defects in the rental unit
    Substantial failures to comply with state/local building and health codes
    Tenants are required by law to take reasonable care of their rental units and are responsible for repair of all damage that results from their neglect or abuse.

## ask how to get repairs
* faq/ask_repairs
 -  Tenants should put all repair requests in writing, keep a copy, and allow at least 30-days for non-emergency repairs. Emergencies, like no hot water or no heat, should be completed within 72 hours. (Cal. Civ. Code §1929, 1941,1941.1)

## ask notice before moving
* faq/ask_notice_moving
 -  Based on California Civil Code §1946.1, there are different types of notice required based on the type and length of tenancy:
    If a tenant is on a month-to-month lease and has resided in the unit less than 1 year, the landlord is only required to give a 30-day notice.
    If a tenant is on a month-to-month lease and has resided in the unit for 1 year or more, the landlord is required to give a 60-day notice.
    If a tenant is on a periodic lease (such as a one-year lease), the landlord must allow the tenant to reside in the unit for the remainder of the term.
    You should not be given a notice to move for exercising your rights under the law. Cal. Civ. Code §1942.5 (a).

## ask difference lease and month-to-month
* faq/ask_lease_difference
 -  Yes, periodic leases usually require you to commit to a time frame of 3, 6, 9, or 12 months. The month-to-month contract does not and can be terminated by either party with proper notice.
    The benefits of a periodic lease are that the rents cannot be increased during the lease term, and the tenant has a place to reside for the full lease term as long as they abide by the terms.  One of the benefits of a month-to-month contract is having the flexibility to move when you choose.

## ask source income
* faq/ask_souce_income
 -  The law allows landlords to ask about the source of an applicant’s income as long as they do not discriminate based on that information. (example: Social Security income not allowed)

## ask separate income requirement
* faq/ask_separate_income
 -  Landlords must use the minimum income requirement in the same way for members of a married couple as for members of any household. (Cal Govt. Code §12955(n) and (o)).

## ask lease spanish
* faq/ask_lease_spanish
 -  It depends on whether the landlord discussed the lease in Spanish, and whether and how a translator was involved in lease discussions. California state law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1632) spells out the rules on the subject.
    If the landlord and your father discussed the lease primarily in Spanish, the landlord must give your father (the tenant) an unsigned version of the lease in Spanish before asking your father to sign the lease. But if your father supplied his own translator, such as an adult child (maybe you), who is not a minor and who can speak and read Spanish and English fluently, the rule does not apply. This means the landlord does not need to give your father a copy of the lease in Spanish.
    The rule does apply (that is, the landlord must give your father an unsigned version of the lease in Spanish) if:
    your father supplied a translator who does not meet the above two requirements (in terms of age and language fluency—for example, if your teenage daughter was the translator during lease discussions) or
    the landlord did the translation (or supplied a translator) during lease discussions.
    The above California rules also apply to leases negotiated in other languages, specifically Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Korean.

## ask prohibit waterbed
* faq/ask_prohibit_waterbed
 -  Whether the landlord can refuse your waterbed request depends on the age of your building.
    If the rental property is more than 40 years old (built before January, 1973), a landlord may legally refuse to rent to a tenant who has a waterbed.
    But if the building was constructed after 1973, the landlord may have to allow you to have a waterbed. Under state law in California (Cal. Civ. Code § 1940.5), landlords of rental property built after 1973 cannot refuse to allow tenants waterbeds if the tenant obtains a replacement-value $100,000 waterbed insurance policy and gives at least 24 hours’ written notice before installing the waterbed, with the landlord to be present when this occurs. In addition, the waterbed must meet specified construction standards set by the California State Bureau of Home Furnishings.
    The landlord may also be able to charge a higher security deposit in California (an additional half-month’s rent) to tenants with waterbeds.

## ask required to make habitable
* faq/ask_make_habitable
 -  Your landlord is required to make a rental unit habitable before turning over the keys. Under the “implied warranty of habitability,” your landlord must fix any problems that severely affect your health and safety. 
    He or she must also repair conditions that fail to comply with the state or local building and health codes. If a landlord breaches the implied warranty of habitability, then you should consider legal action. 

## ask refuse repair
* faq/ask_refuse_repair
 -  If your landlord refuses to maintain the premises or rental unit, then you should immediately file a complaint in writing. The complaint should include a detailed description of the problem, along with any health or safety complications you are experiencing. If you live in a city with rent control, then you should register your complaint with the housing department.
    Your landlord may choose to ignore your complaint or refuse to make any repairs. If this is the case, then the following options are available to you: 
    Making the repairs yourself and deducting the costs from your rent. 
    Moving out and suing your landlord for any expenses incurred. 
    Organizing with other tenants and acquiring legal representation. 

## ask pay exterminator
* faq/ask_pay_exterminator
 -  If your rental unit is infested with rodents, insects or other pests, then your landlord is required to pay for an exterminator.

    Submitting a written description or itemized list of any problems. 
    Requesting that the problems be addressed before you commit to signing a lease agreement. 

## ask how often raise rent
* faq/ask_raise_frequency
 -  If you have a lease for more than 30 days, then your landlord cannot raise your rent during the term of the lease. However, if you have a periodic rental agreement (month-to-month), then your landlord can increase your rent but must give you advance notice in writing. 

    In areas with rent control, your rent can only be raised a fixed percentage once every 12 months.

## ask application fee
* faq/ask_application_fee
 -  In California, property owners are allowed to collect an application/credit check fee up to $44.00 so long as the owner/manager provides the prospective tenant with an itemized receipt for the fee. The owner must only furnish a copy of the credit report to the prospective resident, if requested.

## ask rent receipt
* faq/ask_rent_receipt

## ask nonrefundable deposit
* faq/ask_nonrefundable_deposit
 -  No. California Civil Code Section 1950.5(m) prohibits ALL rental agreements and leases from characterizing a security deposit is "nonrefundable." There is no such thing as a non-refundable security deposit no matter how it is characterized: (i) last month's rent, (ii) move-in fee, (iii) pet deposit, (iv) key deposit, etc. All money paid by a tenant beyond the first month's rent is a security deposit and is refundable.

## ask repair deduct
* faq/ask_repair_deduct
 -  California Civil Code Section 1942 allows a tenant to use the "repair and deduct" remedy to deduct up to one month's rent to pay for repairs of substandard conditions in the rental unit that are affecting the health and safety of the occupants, and substantially breach the implied warranty of habitability (e.g. no working toilet, no hot water, a gas leak, a leak in the roof during a storm or while a storm is approaching).

    The repair and deduct remedy should only be used to make absolutely needed repairs of serious conditions.

    We also strongly suggest that prior to availing yourself of this remedy, that you consult with a local landlord-tenant attorney, or legal aid foundation that handles landlord-tenant matters.

## ask forced to move
* faq/ask_intimidation
 -  California Civil Code Section 1940.2(b) allows a tenant to go into Small Claims Court and sue the landlord for $2000 for nuisance if the landlord tries to force a tenant to move through:

    Conduct that constitutes theft or extortion; or
    Threats, force or menacing conduct that interferes with the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the rental unit and would create the fear of harm in a reasonable person; or
    Abuse of the landlord's right to enter the rental unit (entry without proper notice and for no real purpose other than to harass and annoy).

## ask notice increase
* faq/ask_notice_increase
 -  Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 827(b) and Code of Civil Procedure Section 1013, a landlord's notice of a rent increase must be in writing and served either personally or by first class mail. If the rent increase is 10% of less the tenant must be served with written notice of the rent increase personally at least 30 days in advance, and if by mail 35 days in advance. If the rent increase exceeds 10%, the landlord must personally serve the tenant written notice of the rental increase at least 60 days in advance, and if by mail 65 days in advance.

## ask proper service
* faq/ask_proper_service
 -  California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162 allows a landlord, the landlord's agent, or anyone over 18 to serve a 3-Day Notice, 30-Day Notice or 60-Day Notice on the tenant in one of three ways:
    by personal service (you are personally handed the Notice);
    by substituted service (the Notice is left with a person over the age of 18 at your home or work and a copy is mailed to your rental unit's address); or
    by posting and mailing (the Notice is tacked to the entrance of the rental unit and a copy is mailed to your rental unit's address).
    Effective January 1, 2007, Civil Code Section 1946.1(f) now permits a landlord to send the notice to the tenant by certified or registered mail return receipt requested.
    If the Notice was personally served, the notice period begins to run the day after the tenant receives the notice. If the Notice was served by substituted service, the notice period begins to run the day after the notice was both served and mailed. If the Notice was served by posting, the notice period begins to run the day after the notice was posted and mailed. Please note that the effective date is the date of mailing, not the date the Notice is actually received.
